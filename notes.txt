Need a play again button in practice mode/way to restart game

Need an option to disable note timer 
    - current aproach is to hide the timer value by using dieplay none in css
        - however timer still decrments it is just invisible. Possible workaround set to infinite time if yes is selected

        To do: attach a listener on disable note timer. This toggles between 'yes' and 'no'
            If 'yes' is selected set display: none for localNoteTimer html element AND set the local clock to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
            else make sure display for timer element is activie AND initial local clock value holds
